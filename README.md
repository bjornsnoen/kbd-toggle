# Rust kbd-toggle

## Old problems require stupid solutions
When run, this program will figure out which keyboard layout you're currently on, and then activate the next one. But only if you're using X11.

This is not indended to be used by anyone except me, but I can't tell you what to do. I just needed something to do while learning rust.


## Installation
```sh
cargo build
cargo install --path .
```

Or if you're feeling frisky
```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bjornsnoen/kbd-toggle.git
```

## Usage
`kbd-toggle`

# But seriously don't, there are better solutions
